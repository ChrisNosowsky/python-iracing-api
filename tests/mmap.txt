Memory file tests
-----------------

Specifically, if it's not there.

If iRacing is not running, the memory mapped file will not exist. We handle this
by raising an exception - this happens when there is no file, or the file is
there, but empty.

    >>> import api
    >>> api_client = api.API()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    Exception: iRacing memory mapped file could not be found
