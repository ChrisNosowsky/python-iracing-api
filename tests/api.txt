iRacing API client
==================

Tests for the iRacing API client.

Data file
---------

This series of tests will work with a cached copy of the memory file, so we need
to get that.

    >>> import os
    >>> mmap_file = os.path.join('tests', 'memorydump.dmp')
    >>> mmap_f = open(mmap_file, 'r+b')

And we need to convince the API client that it should actually be using this
file instead of vainly looking in memory for iRacing's. We do this by creating a
file with the correct tag for the API client to inspect.

    >>> import api
    >>> import mmap
    >>> mocked_mmap = mmap.mmap(mmap_f.fileno(), api.MEMMAPFILESIZE,
    ...                         'Local\\IRSDKMemMapFileName')
    >>> api_client = api.API()

YAML (session)
--------------

There is YAML generated for the session, and it updates slowly. The YAML has
is accessable through nested keys.

    >>> api_client['DriverInfo']['DriverHeadPosX']
    -0.025000000000000001

    >>> api_client['SessionInfo']['Sessions'][0]['ResultsFastestLap'][0]['FastestTime']
    0.0

    >>> api_client['SessionInfo']['Sessions'][0]['ResultsFastestLap'][0]['CarIdx']
    255

Telemetry
---------

There is telemetry updated 60 times a second, we can access that in the same
way.

    >>> api_client['Speed']
    1.7011767625808716

Helpers
-------

There are some convenience helpers too - you can access the client like a dict
so the keys are available too:

    >>> keys = api_client.keys()
    >>> len(keys)
    101

    >>> 'SessionInfo' in keys
    True
    
    >>> 'Speed' in keys
    True
