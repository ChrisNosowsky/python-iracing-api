iRacing API client
==================

Tests for the iRacing API client.

Data file
---------

This series of tests will work with a cached copy of the memory file, so we need
to get that.

    >>> import os
    >>> mmap_file = os.path.join('tests', 'memorydump.txt')
    >>> mmap_f = open(mmap_file, 'r+b')

And we need to convince the API client that it should actually be using this
file instead of vainly looking in memory for iRacing's. We do this by creating a
file with the correct tag for the API client to inspect.

    >>> import api
    >>> import mmap
    >>> mocked_mmap = mmap.mmap(mmap_f.fileno(), api.MEMMAPFILESIZE,
    ...                         'Local\\IRSDKMemMapFileName')

    >>> yaml = api.API().yaml
    >>> yaml['DriverInfo']['DriverHeadPosX']
